## 🆕 Founding

---

UBC PMC was founded by Rachit Malik and Rithvik Alluri in May 2020.

Here’s a post made by Rachit on r/ubc to gauge interest for a product management club at UBC: 

> My friend and I were thinking of starting a Product Management club/community where we all could get together, learn more about the Product role through industry talks, networking events, mock interviews & get relevant experience through projects. In general our vision is to make this a community for students trying to break into the PM role and help new PMs!

## 💁 Mentorship Program

---

Coordinated by Elizabeth Hui, former Community Manager of PMC.

**Events:**

- Kick-off
- Finale

## 🏃‍♀️ Product Sprint

---

[Product Sprint](https://ubcpm.club/productsprint) was the most ambitious initiative that UBC PMC has created to date. It intensely involved all functional areas of the club—events, industry partnerships, marketing, design, website dev, and developed new areas of research and curriculum development.

Aiming to bridge the gap between students and industry, Product Sprint tackled the “chicken and egg” problem of candidates unable to obtain a PM job without PM experience. Over two weeks, 24 teams of competitors explored a problem space provided by a PM of Hootsuite, EY, BuildDirect, or Kinzoo. After gathering inputs, defining the problem, and designing a solution, they pitched to the company and were awarded thousands of dollars in prizes.

### Advisors

---

Timothy Yeung and Steven Harbaruk, who spoke at the [Discover PM 2021](https://www.notion.so/PMC-History-89033a658a264f81a4441f5e5bc50794) event, joined the team as advisors.

**[Timothy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yeungtimothy)** was President @ ProductBC & Associate Director of Product Management @ EY.

**[Steven](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharbaruk/?originalSubdomain=ca)** was Lead PM @ Grammarly.

---

### Judging Criteria

---

Judging criteria were based on Produthon’s criteria—which we thought needed some improvement—and Marty Cagan’s “4 risks” of any product:

- User Value
- Design Usability
- Technical Feasibility
- Business Viability

---

### Curriculum Development

---

The competition was split into four phases: 

- Discovery
- Solution
- Construction
- Presentation

Each phase started with a workshop presentation, which taught participants the necessary skills for the respective sessions. Participants were given pre-workshop materials and had the chance to collaborate with their mentors for the workshop exercises. To keep track of participant progress, teams were also required to complete a mandatory check-in with their mentors through each phase.

Additional rewards were given to participants who actively show their learning on our Discord channel.

---

### Decisions: mentorship, cases

---

**Mentorship**

We had two main ideas for mentorship. First, we could copy Produthon, where there were drop-in “Mentor Office Hours.” Mentors were assigned time slots and participants could optionally show up to each session. Our second option was to assign mentors to teams, which was more technically challenging and would require more mentors. Each team would be assigned to two mentors, who would support the participants throughout the course of the competition. 

We eventually decided that assigning each team a mentor was a better idea. With a supporting mentor, participants felt more included and cared for–thus, more commitment. This also generated more value for both participants and mentors: participants would gain more tailored feedback on their ideas. Mentors gain more satisfaction by seeing the participants grow.
